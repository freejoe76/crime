published: 2013-05-12

Denver Crimes is a publication dedicated to giving context and illuminating the day-to-day crime around Denver. I’m Joe Murphy, your journalist. I’m starting with Capitol Hill (the statistical Cap Hill, as defined by the City of Denver — that’s the 14,000 people who live south of Colfax, north of 7th Ave., east of Broadway and west of Downing).
