# This script downloads the current edition of the City of Denver's crime files.
# If there are changes to the file since we last downloaded it, we:
#     1. Save a copy of those differences with a timestamp
#     2. Save that copy of those differences to latestdiff.csv
#     3. Update the current-year csv with the results, currentyear.csv
#
# It takes two arguments:
#     -t / --test, which skips all file-writing operations except initial download
#     -n / --nodl, which skips the csv download, and assumes an existing new.csv file is in place.
#     -l / --location, for building archives on a particular location.
### * Note: Should look at the diffs and see at what age the data stops changing. From there,
### can build a more refined archiving (and, thus, querying) strategy.
